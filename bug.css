The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there is a syntax error in the calculation, the entire property will be ignored silently. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px + 10%);` will result in an unexpected `width` because the `+ 10%` is an invalid syntax inside the `calc()` function and the entire expression is ignored.  Another issue is that whitespace can matter.  For example `width: calc(100% - 20 px);`  would be incorrect. It must be `width: calc(100% - 20px);`
