To fix this, carefully check the syntax of your `calc()` expressions. Ensure that all operators and values are correctly placed and that there are no extra spaces between numbers and units. For example, change `width: calc(100% - 20 px);` to `width: calc(100% - 20px);`.  Also, ensure your calculation only contains valid operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) with valid units. For complex calculations, break them down into smaller parts for easier debugging.
